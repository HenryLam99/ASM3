                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <h3> Overview</h3>
                    <p> When assignment 3 started our team had a lot of cool ideas for the project and we also considered if the project idea from assignment 2 was realistic and would help society, have a huge impact on the IT industry or not. After giving out a lot of ideas we decided to do the “Hand Glove for Physical Challenged people (deaf/mute)”. We all love studying about new programing languages and learn new things about IT but one thing that was not consider ways to use our knowledge and technology to help physically challenged people and also this is an opportunity for use to learn about something that does not often come up in the course, limit testing ourself on something extremely new. The IT industry trend in 2021 is a lot about helping businesses to secure their customer data or better customer service and communication, or creating new content for people to follow on social media, cloud computing but helping people that was not so lucky and have physical disabilities was not a trend and people started to forget that we create new technology is to make our life become better. So even though we are really familiar with coding and other software base projects we decided to try this project idea. This is something that does not help our team members' ideal job as we all want to have a job that is mostly about developing software but helping the society better is something that is really valuable to learn and may help us in the future. Even though the comment on our project idea was a really good idea and quite complex to do but it not something quite new and challenging also we thought that people put so much effort into the entertainment industry and use technology to make it even better but we had forgot to help people with disabilities to have a better life so that they may not feel like they have a disadvantage in life compared to normal people.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Detailed Description</h3>
                    <h4>Aims</h4>
                    <p>Our aims for this project is to help change the way that deaf and mute people communicate with normal people, after lot of research about problems that deaf and mute people may met in their daily life we found out that even with the existing technology like the bone conduction headphone that help the deaf people can hear what other people is saying but the problem is that when they use the “hand-talk” languages to communicate with normal people a lot of people do not understand that languages and so that they will not understand what the deaf and mute people so that with our glove we aims that a cheap and familiar to user products so that help disabilities people to have a easier life to communicate to other people. Nowaday people started to focus more on the entertainment industry and using the technology to enhance it but people with less luck and with disabilities did not have that same fun and have a lot of difficulties in their life, also helping disabilities people was never an IT industry trend so our team want to help the society and make people realise that using technology is about helping people are not lucky like us to have the same life experiences like everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Plans and Progress</h4>
                    <p>When assignment 3 started we contacted each other and then set a day to start working on the project. When we schedule the meeting we first look back at the project idea from the past assignment and find out that it was quite complex and some parts are almost unrealistic or is really hard for us in order to do or have an idea that everyone will understand about the project. So we started to do research and gave out a lot of interesting ideas after voting and thinking if the project is possible for us to do we decided on the “hand glove for physical challenges(deaf/mue)”. This is based on a real life scenario of a deaf person in daily life and the project will help them to solve the problems.Until now, when we have had the opportunity to follow our desired career and learn about incredible things. That which appears to be far-fetched is actually within grasp, which is just what we are discovering. That was our inspiration for creating the product for our final ASM. A glove with an associated application that helps to adapt speech and signals to make it simpler may communicate speech through motions. With this device, we believe that persons with disabilities will have a better quality of life and will no longer feel excluded from society. At first the project idea sounded really cool and interesting. Also this project is something that was not similar to all of us as this requires our team members to have a strong knowledge about understanding how hardware works, especially Arduino. This project is a really challenging task for all of us but we decided to test our limits. First we started to do the research on what area of the project, for example how it works, will people decide to use it or not,... after finding out areas that needed to be solved we started to fit in our role to solve the problems. We use the google Doc to write down the script and share it with other team members after a few days of working on the script and fixing what is wrong, we decided to do the presentation as Nhat he decided to use a famous film that mainly talks about life of a deaf girl and how her problems impacts her in order for other students can easily understand why we do project and what our project will help to solve all those problems. This was asked and agreed by all team members. When we do the power points we do it together and each team member gives out their idea of what they saw wrong on their slide and gives out an idea to solve the problem. After a few days of editing and fixing the slides we finally had a complete version of the powerpoint presentation. Then our team members schedule a meeting so that we can practice a quick talk to prepare mentally and physically for the presentation  day. We gave feedback on how each team member can improve their presenting skills in front of the class and have a strong mentality so that we will not make mistakes when the presentation day comes. Even though some members struggled when standing in front of the whole class and they could not perform 100% as practice, we still did a good job on our roles. We had talked about our research data show and about how the device works,.. This task was quite hard for our team members as we did not have much skill on hardware and we are not familiar with standing in front of the audience. But after the presentation day we gave out a clear aim that people should use technology to help people who were not lucky to have normal life like us to enhance their life experience instead of just focusing on entertaining our life and forgetting the people that were not so lucky. We had created a prototype for the project we planned to bring it in front of the whole class but sadly the project did not work like we planned. Maybe it was because our skill was not good enough to make it worked properly. So that is why we only had one slide about the picture of the project. After the presentation day we sat down with each other to talk about what we could have done better and to try to improve our mentality when presenting in front of the class. </p>

                    <h3> Scope and Limits</h3>
                    <p> Because from the beginning the project was aimed at a small market, people with disabilities. People make up only a small percentage of a large market, so our initial vision was not really high, simply serving a normal and easier life for people with disabilities. The project has only a few simple functions of converting sign language into speech and establishing its own sign language. The development potential of the project is great but not enough to hit a broader market. Right now we are only freshmen, so we still don't have much experience in product development. But with the vision we had, we were sure my product would be very successful after it came out but would falter at some point. What we need to do is improve it and maybe target more people than people with disabilities. We can turn it into a multi-functional glove such as a language interpreter, health check or add an IoT function to connect with other devices around, so everything will be easier because things are directly through the hands. According to our vision. This product will be completed in about sophomore year and it will probably be a potential project for us to use in our senior year once it is completed and developed.</p>
                    <h3> Testing</h3>
                    <p> We used the Arduino kit for this project and we tried to connect wires, main board and gloves together. It isn’t easy for the first time to make a project like this so we have to do some research on the internet for it. We used a simulator for this project because our team doesn't have enough  equipment to make a completed product. We have to deal with a lot of issues like the gloves need an Android app to produce the sound so we tried our best to do it. But the code that we set up for the product works well and nothing is unusual. We tried to test on some disable person as a volunteer but we couldn't find anyone so we tested by ourselves. If we can find a volunteer, one or two people will be enough for testing the product. </p>
                    <h4> Plans and Progress</h4>

                    <h3> Risks </h3>
                    <p> I think there were plenty of risks in our project when we did this assignment. I think most of the risks come from the components of the product because we may have bought a bad quality component for it and it won’t work as well as we expected. Moreover, it can be related to coding because sometimes we have to spend a lot of time debugging and fixing things that are suitable for the project. We have to test the product because it may be error or broken when the project is completed. </p>
                    <h3> Testing</h3>
                    <p> We used the Arduino kit for this project and we tried to connect wires, main board and gloves together. It isn’t easy for the first time to make a project like this so we have to do some research on the internet for it. We used a simulator for this project because our team doesn't have enough  equipment to make a completed product. We have to deal with a lot of issues like the gloves need an Android app to produce the sound so we tried our best to do it. But the code that we set up for the product works well and nothing is unusual. We tried to test on some disable person as a volunteer but we couldn't find anyone so we tested by ourselves. If we can find a volunteer, one or two people will be enough for testing the product. </p>
                    <h4>Group processes and  Communications</h4>
                    <p>In this project, we used email and Facebook for communication because these foundations are convenient to connect to each other. Moreover, we still have a face to face meeting if there are any important issues related to the project. If I have a group member who doesn’t respond to communications, we will use contributions form and give them a zero for participation. </p>

                    <p>If there is an opportunity to be noticed by investors, it will be an important step for our project to come closer to the community and serve people with disabilities. Once you have a certain financial resource, it will no longer be difficult to buy components for the product or hire someone to manufacture the product. With the intentions that I have outlined about the process of completing the product within 16 weeks. Bringing this project to production will only be a matter of time. At this point, we need to prepare for the next phase of how to bring this product to market. We will need to have a team of 4 take on 4 different roles. In general, I require roles such as supply chain manager, product marketing, support app development, and product web manager. This can be considered as a big project, so it is essential for members to support each other. And skills such as teamwork, communication, diligence and self-development mindset.</p>

                    <h3>Nguyen Minh Nhat</h3>
                    <p>Our group communicating with each other was really smooth as we had worked with each other for quite a long time so we had improved our communication by a lot. At first we set a day to start to do the project after giving out ideas, then we chose the best idea, then we scheduled a meeting on messenger to talk about how we would do it. I feel like we know each other quite well so everyone works really well together, even when we work online or face to face. We scheduled the meeting for around half an hour and then we asked each team member about how they feel about the project. After we used Google Doc to share and write scripts we scheduled another meeting to talk about what will happen in the powerpoint and planned on how we will talk about the project. We also went to Minh house to use a face to face method of meeting. It takes almost a lot of time as we joked and played around  then make quite a bit of time to start concentrating back on the task. As everything was ready perfectly like we practiced for the presentation and then gave feedback by using messenger calls it lasted around more than half an hour. But when things came to real presentation in front of the class my teammates got quite scared as they were not used to standing in front of the crowd so mistakes happened but first time for everything as we can take this as a lesson to improve our mental for the next time we present for a project. One thing that surprised me is that we decided on this project as we are all familiar with coding and studying about software but this is almost all about hardware and it is something that is not quite popular and our team decided to limit testing ourselves and the project aims were quite different when compared to the IT industry trend.</p>
                    <h3>Ly Quoc Phuc</h3>
                    <p>In this final week of the course, I and my teammates just finished the final assignment of Introduction to IT. I think I did my best for the presentation and the final report because my partners and I had discussed a lot and supported each other. We have shown the strengths and weaknesses of each member and we fixed the development of teamwork. Although there are some problems in our projects like coding, functions of the product or slides of the presentation, we still tried to debug it by ourselves first then we discussed it when we nearly finished the project. In the future, I will improve myself by trying to learn new things or projects about the IT world. Moreover, I will learn more about teamwork so I can do the group project more smoothly. Furthermore, I will practice the presentation skill because I don’t good at this skill and I am very shy when I stand in front of lots of people. Overall, I think everything in this final project is better than the last assignment because I learned from the failures and try to develop myself to a better version. There aren’t any issues related to communication of the group so I am satisfied about that. </p>
                    <h3>Lam Quang Minh</h3>
                    <p>All group activities and plans are fulfilled on time in the vast majority of cases. The collective performance of the squad, on the other hand, has fallen short of expectations. Despite this, everything continues to run smoothly. The special thing about the group astonished me is  everyone's strong sense of duty and self-discipline; everyone was willing to assist one another; and everyone worked tirelessly to ensure the group's overall success. Thanks to the group activities, I've improved my ability to deal with challenging situations.
                        Each member of the group meets twice a week for around 3-4 hours each time. Throughout the conference, all members shared information, considered solutions, and devised a method for conducting the tasks.</p>
                    <h3>Du Tuan Vu</h3>
                    <p>During the 4 weeks of working with the group, I felt like I had found my soul mates in my early college years. Because we understand each other very well, in the process of working there are not any arguments or disagreements. But the information that an individual provides is supported by everyone and executes it smoothly. During the first few days, because one of our team members was sick, the meetings were usually online and cyclic twice a week and everything was pre-arranged on messenger and each meeting. Usually lasts 30 minutes to 1 hour. As for the implementation of the project, we do everything online such as creating google.doc files, pdf files and github files to make websites. Every time we do, we focus on one thing and get it done in one meeting. Last week we had the opportunity to meet face-to-face and gather at a member's home. Here we had a chance to talk about each person's future direction and practice speaking and presenting products. However, there were still some errors and unforeseen circumstances that prevented my group from performing well in the presentation. but everyone also encouraged and comforted each other and tried to be better next time. One thing that I find quite surprising is that we are the only team using arduino in our product and the project is more hardware oriented like connecting it to IoT like other teams. Since this is a product created to assist people with disabilities, those functions were not our goal in the first place, so in general, our project is a bit disadvantageous to other groups because it doesn't present it. Present unique ideas and clear products.</p>
